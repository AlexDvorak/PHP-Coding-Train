<h1>Java and Javascript Translation to PHP</h1>
The goal of this repository is to translate Daniel Shiffman's (Coding Train's) code written in Javascript and Java into pure PHP source code. I am trying to replicate the original code as close as possible but of course that isn't always possible with array indexes and other things.
