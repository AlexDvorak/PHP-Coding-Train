<h1>Java and Javascript Translation to PHP</h1>
The goal of this repository is to translate <a href="http://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code">Daniel Shiffman's (Coding Train's) code</a> written in Javascript and Java into pure PHP source code. I am trying to replicate the original code as close as possible but of course that isn't always possible with array indexes and other things.
